# What is this project?

This project is a landing page for a fake gym called RonniesGym. It was a simple project that I created to practice designing landing pages and recreating those designs using ReactJS. This project took me about a days worth of work from start to finish. This included designing the landing page in figma and recreating the design in React. For styling, I added my own custom styling using SASS.
